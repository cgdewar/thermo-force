# The Future of Virtual Reality
<hr>
Virtual reality (VR) is an extremely promising technology, one bordering on science fiction levels of futurism, that is 
not being utilized as well as it could be. We're trying to change that! 

> VR is a way to escape the real world into something more fantastic. It has the potential to be the most social 
> technology of all time
> <br /> - Palmer Luckey, Founder of Oculus Rift

# The Project
<hr>
The focus of our project is to improve current feedback and/or inclusion of new 
feedback is needed to help realize the full potential of VR. We are realizing this goal
by creating a VR system with temperature and weight feedback!

# The Product
<hr>
Our product allows users to immerse themselves in a new world of VR; we are building a set 
of glove that, when connected to a VR system, can track the user's hands and provide automatic
weight and temperature feedback.
